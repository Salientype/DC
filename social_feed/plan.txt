*Social Feed Project*

*Overview:* You are startup that has decided Facebook and Twitter is for old people. 
So you are going to make your own social feed application. You application should perform the following:

- A user is able to enter data into an input area. Think like Twitter or Facebook.
--- create container for user input
- At the very least, their should be a text area, and a input where the user is able to enter the url of image from online
--- create text input for title, create text area element (max chars), text element for URL (validate), create a submit btn
--- Bonus: Give the user the ability to select the text color
- When the user submits their data, it should go into a feed that exist on the page
--- Create a container for feed
- The username, time the user submitted the post, and the content should appear on the page
--- feed item: Display User's Name, display title, display timestamp, display text and/or image content.
- Figure out how to prevent users from entering bad data (ie, no text or not an image)
- As the username adds more post, it should also be added to the feed
- The user should have the ability to delete a post
- BONUS: Give the ability for the user to update the post in the feed.
